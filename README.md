# Bust A Movie
Your one-stop-shop for finding a playlist that brings you right back to your favorite movies. Search your movie, and we will provide you with a playlist that fits right in with that genre.
## Usage
Our group was assigned to create a web application from scratch that serves a purpose in the real world. We have decided to create a movie themed website where the user can search movies and be given feedback on the movies genre and a Spotify playlists associated with the genre. Using a variation of an IMDB API called OMDB and a Spotify API the user would find what genre the movie is such as Action or Comedy and then be able to locate a Spotify playlist with that same genre. Hopefully giving the user songs that they might have heard in a movie they watched and then be able to find it using our web service. The user could also simply use the application to find new music or movies based on shared interests.
